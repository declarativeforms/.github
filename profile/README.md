# Declarative Forms
Git-native forms and surveys

Declarative Forms is a developer-first alternative to traditional form platforms. Instead of building forms through drag-and-drop editors or managing data in proprietary dashboards, forms are defined directly in GitHub repositories as declarative configuration.

This model makes forms easier to reason about, version, and evolve alongside the rest of a codebase. Declarative Forms is built for teams that want predictable behavior, explicit control, and workflows that fit naturally into Git-based development.

It sits between visual form builders and low-level APIs — structured enough to express real form logic, without requiring custom frontends or bespoke infrastructure.
