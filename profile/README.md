# Declarative Forms
Git-native forms and surveys

Declarative Forms is a developer-first alternative to traditional form platforms. Instead of building forms through visual editors, forms are defined as declarative configuration in a GitHub repository.

This approach lets forms evolve alongside your codebase, using the same workflows teams already rely on for collaboration, review, and change management. It’s designed for developers who want a more predictable, maintainable way to create and manage forms—without being constrained by opaque UIs.
